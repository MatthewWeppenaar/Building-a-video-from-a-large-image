input 'make' to compile: This will compile code and  create binaries 

example runs are included, but if you want to create your own trajectory you can do it like this:
  extractor <inputPGMfile> [options]

  -t <int> <int> <int> <int> # x1 y1 x2 y2 (begin & end origin pixel coords, for frame trajectory)
  -s <int> <int> # <width> <height> (size of small frame in pixels)
  -w <string> <string> # write frames with <operation> <name>
For the -w flag, the parameter <operation> = none | invert | reverse | revinvert,
  where, 
  none: no modification of data, 
  invert: each pixel value v become 255-v, 
  reverse:
  reverse output (write frames out from last to first), 
  revinvert: reverse and invert output. 
  The parameter <name> = name of sequence base e.g. sequence-0000.pgm, sequence0001.pgm etc will be generated with <name> set to ‘sequence’.
-t and -s are specified once, but you can have one or more -w operations
specifed, each of which outputs a different frame sequence

So an example run could look like this:
./extractor myLargeImage.pgm -t 0 10 5000 5000 -s 640 480 -w invert invseq -w none sequence2 

Then, "make generate_video" will create a video using the frame sequence created.

"make clean": removes binaries, generated pgm files, video and execution files

Example runs are included(all runs except run1 use "sloan.pgm"):  To run, "make <run_name>"
  run: positive trajectory
  run1: positive trajectory with a few operations  
  run2: positive trajectory with a few operations  
  run3: positive trajectoty in reverse direction  
  run4: negative trajectory  
  run5: negative trajectory in reverse direction  
  run6: vertical trajectory  
  run7: horizontal trajectory  
  run8: horizontal trajectory in revese direction
  run9: horizontal trajectory reverse direction
  run10: positive trajectory
